# The problems below ask you to create several lists using only
# the list named pi, the list named e, and these list operations:
#
# list indexing such as pi[0]
# list slicing such as e[1:]
# skip-slicing such as pi[6:4:-1]
# list concatenation, +, such as pi[1:] + e[1:]
# (Do not use + to add values numerically.)
# the list-making operator, [ , ], for example:
#     [ e[2], e[0] ]

pi = [3,1,4,1,5,9]
e = [2,7,1]

# Use pi and/or e to create the list [2,5,9] (answer0)
answer0 =
print (answer0)

# Use pi and/or e to create the list [7,1]. (answer1)
# Use pi and/or e to create the list [9,1,1]. (answer2)
# Use pi and/or e to create the list [1,4,1,5,9]. (answer3)
# Use pi and/or e to create the list [1,2,3,4,5]. (answer4)
