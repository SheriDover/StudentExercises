# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list
# of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it
# is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a
# divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

# Remember you can generate a list using range(start, stop)
# range(2,10) == [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
