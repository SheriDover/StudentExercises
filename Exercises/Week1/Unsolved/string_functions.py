# Write a function checkends(s), which takes in a string s and returns
# True if the first character in s is the same as the last character
# in s. It returns False otherwise.

# You will need to use the if condition1 == condition2: / else: construct
# and the string slice to accomplish this. Don't return strings.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# checkends('no match') == False
# checkends('hah! a match') == True
# checkends('q') == True
# checksends(' ') == True

# Write a function flipside(s), which takes a string s and returns a string
# whose first half is s's second half and whose second half is s's first
# half. If len(s) is odd then the first half of s should be shorter.

# Examples:

# flipside('homework') == workhome  (len(s) is even)
# flipside('carpets') == petscar    (len(s) is odd)

# write convertFromSeconds(s), which takes an integer number of seconds
# and returns a list of four integers that represents that number of seconds
# in [days, hours, minutes, seconds]

# Examples:
#
# convertFromSeconds(610) == [0, 0, 10, 10]
# convertFromSeconds(100000) == [1, 3, 46, 40]
