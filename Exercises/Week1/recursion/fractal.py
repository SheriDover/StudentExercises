# branching-recursion: It's in branching that recursion is at

# We are creating a smaller version of the overall structure at more

# The key to making "branching-recursion" work is making sure that your
# turtle ends at the same location that it begins. That is how you know
# that the statements after the recursive calls are moving the turtle
# as expected.
